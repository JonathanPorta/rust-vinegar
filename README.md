Vinegar for Rust Oxide
============

Vinegar is an Oxide plugin for the Rust which allows players to modify structures and determine who owns the structure. It also allows the player to build non-standard structures.

Vinegar uses the Oxmin flag system for permissions.

--/vinegar

Vinegar integrates with Oxmin's flag system to manage permissions.

Simply give the user the "canvinegar" flag.

To toggle destruction, use the chat command "/vinegar".

With Vinegar enabled, the user then destroy structures that they own. This includes walls, foundations, pillars, ceilings.

If the user is in god mode, they can destroy anyone's structure.

To deactivate destruction, toggle Vinegar off using /vinegar.

--/prod

Prod allows the user to see the owner of any structure.

To toggle prod, use the chat command "/prod".

This requires the Oxmin flag "canprod".
